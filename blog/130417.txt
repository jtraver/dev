Love is choice.

Love is choice. If I am not at choice, I am not in love.

Love is a tricky word in our culture. This little map keeps me feeling on track when love feels confusing.

Ironically, choice only flows from choiceless awareness.

Feel into yourself. Notice all that is going on. Who is noticing? This is choiceless awareness, called many different names like Witness or Emptiness or Mind. This is you. A gateway to Big Mind.

We normally think we are the “all that is going on”. This is a misidentification. The first of many.

The “all that is going on” is Fullness. It all arises from Emptiness, from you. There is no choosing in the “all that is going on”. It is a computer program running on your brain according to the laws of physics. It is also called Reactive Mind. I usually just call it my brain.

I typically think of Emptiness as an attribute of Light and Fullness as an attribute of Life.

But choice requires three options, else you have just an ultimatum. To have another option you need the Other.

The Other introduces two more points of view for a total of four: Emptiness, Fullness, Other and We.

Now if you go back into your choiceless awareness you will notice another quality: Heart, the gateway to Big Heart.

From the place of Emptiness, feel into Fullness, Other and We. Then make your choice. You can map these positions out on the floor or in chairs and physically move to them. It helps.
