After Ken Wilber's Mythic-Literal stage (where meaning is found in concrete stories and deities), the next major development in his model is the Synthetic-Conventional stage, followed by the Individuative-Reflective stage, moving towards more complex, abstract, and ultimately integral or non-dual awareness, incorporating critical thinking and a wider sense of self beyond traditional structures.
Here's the typical progression:

Intuitive-Projective: Early imagination, powerful images.
Mythic-Literal: Concrete, rule-based, literal understanding of stories and gods (like Santa or a punishing God).
Synthetic-Conventional: Identity tied to community/group beliefs; conformity to shared values.
Individuative-Reflective: Critical thinking, questioning traditions, developing personal values.
Conjunctive: Integrating paradoxes, seeing multiple perspectives.
Universalizing/Integral: Transcending limitations, embracing non-dual awareness, unity.
So, the immediate next step is moving from a literal, story-based faith to one grounded in community, and then into self-reflective critical thought.
