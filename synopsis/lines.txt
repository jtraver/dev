what other "lines of development" are there and what are their stages and who are the prominent researchers of each?

Beyond the common cognitive/Piagetian line, key "lines of development" (or intelligences) include Moral (Kohlberg), Interpersonal, Emotional, Self/Ego (Loevinger, Cook-Greuter), Values/Spirituality (Wilber, Graves), and Needs (Maslow), each with unique stages, showing how people grow in distinct areas like ethics, empathy, self-awareness, and purpose, often mapped by researchers like Ken Wilber (Integral Theory) using frameworks such as Spiral Dynamics (Graves) and Ego Development Stages (Loevinger). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Here are some major lines, their stages, and key researchers:

• Cognitive (Thinking): How we process information.

	• Stages: Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete Operational, Formal Operational (Piaget), extending to Post-Formal/Dialectical Thinking (Perry, Kitchener).
	• Researchers: Jean Piaget, William Perry, Patricia King, Robert Kitchener.

• Moral (Ethics): Understanding "what should be".

	• Stages: Preconventional, Conventional, Postconventional (Kohlberg), evolving to Post-Postconventional (Gilligan, Kohlberg).
	• Researchers: Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan.

• Self/Ego (Identity): Sense of "Who am I?".

	• Stages: Impulsive, Self-Protective, Conformist, Self-Aware, Conscientious, Individualistic, Autonomous, Integrated (Loevinger).
	• Researchers: Jane Loevinger, Susanne Cook-Greuter.

• Interpersonal (Social): Relating to others.

	• Stages: Focus on increasing connection, empathy, and complexity of social understanding (part of Wilber's model).
	• Researchers: (Often integrated within Integral Theory, related to Loevinger/Kohlberg).

• Emotional/Affective (Feelings): Experiencing and managing emotions.

	• Stages: From basic to complex emotional regulation, differentiation, and integration.
	• Researchers: Daniel Goleman (Emotional Intelligence), Integral theorists.

• Needs (Motivation): Hierarchy of human needs.

	• Stages/Levels: Deficiency Needs (Physiological, Safety, Love/Belonging, Esteem) to Growth Needs (Self-Actualization) (Maslow).
	• Researchers: Abraham Maslow, Roberto Assagioli (Psychosynthesis).

• Values/Spiritual (Meaning): What's important; connection to the sacred.

	• Stages: Egocentric, Ethnocentric, Worldcentric, Kosmoscentric (Wilber/Integral) or Beige, Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Teal (Spiral Dynamics).
	• Researchers: Ken Wilber, Clare W. Graves, Don Beck, Chris Cowan.

• Psychosexual/Eros (Life Force): Broadly, the spectrum of life energy (Freud, Jung, Wilber).

	• Stages/Levels: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency, Genital (Freud); broader spectrums in Jungian/Integral thought.
	• Researchers: Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Ken Wilber. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Key Thinkers & Frameworks:

• Ken Wilber (Integral Theory): Synthesizes many lines, mapping them across stages (w1, w2, etc.).
• Spiral Dynamics: Based on Graves' work, mapping values/worldviews (vMemes).
• Ego Development: Loevinger's stages of self-identity [1 [1, 3, 4, 6, 10]
