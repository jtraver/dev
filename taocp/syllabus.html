    Areas of computational mathematics[edit]
    Computational mathematics emerged as a distinct part of applied mathematics by the early 1950s. Currently, computational mathematics can refer to or include:
    computational science, also known as scientific computation or computational engineering
    solving mathematical problems by computer simulation as opposed to analytic methods of applied mathematics
    numerical methods used in scientific computation, for example numerical linear algebra and numerical solution of partial differential equations
    stochastic methods,[2] such as Monte Carlo methods and other representations of uncertainty in scientific computation
    the mathematics of scientific computation,[3] [4], in particular numerical analysis, the theory of numerical methods
    computational complexity
    computer algebra and computer algebra systems
    computer-assisted research in various areas of mathematics, such as logic (automated theorem proving), discrete mathematics,combinatorics), number theory, and computational algebraic topology
    cryptography and computer security, which involve, in particular, research on primality testing, factorization, elliptic curves, and mathematics of blockchain
    computational linguistics, the use of mathematical and computer techniques in natural languages
    computational algebraic geometry
    computational group theory
    computational geometry
    computational number theory
    computational topology
    computational statistics
    algorithmic information theory
    algorithmic game theory
    mathematical economics, the use of mathematics in economics, finance and, to certain extents, of accounting.

    Philosophy[edit]
    Main article: Philosophy of computer science
    A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.[40] Peter Denning's working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.[41] Amnon H. Eden described them as the "rationalist paradigm" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence).[42]
    Areas of computer science[edit]
    Further information: Outline of computer science
    As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.[43][44] CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS)[45]—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.[43]
    Theoretical computer science[edit]
    Main article: Theoretical computer science
    Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.
    Data structures and algorithms[edit]
    Data structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.

    Theory of computation[edit]
    Main article: Theory of computation
    According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be (efficiently) automated?"[12] Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation. The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.
    The famous P = NP? problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems,[46] is an open problem in the theory of computation.

    Information and coding theory[edit]
    Main articles: Information theory and Coding theory
    Information theory is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by Claude Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.[47] Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.
    Programming language theory[edit]
    Main article: Programming language theory
    Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

    Formal methods[edit]
    Main article: Formal methods
    Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.
    Computer systems[edit]
    Computer architecture and computer engineering[edit]
    Main articles: Computer architecture and Computer engineering
    Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.[48] The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.

    Computer performance analysis[edit]
    Main article: Computer performance
    Computer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving throughput, controlling response time, using resources efficiently, eliminating bottlenecks, and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads.[49]
    Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems[edit]
    Main articles: Concurrency (computer science) and Distributed computing
    Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi and the Parallel Random Access Machine model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network. Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal.
    Computer networks[edit]
    Main article: Computer network
    This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.
    Computer security and cryptography[edit]
    Main articles: Computer security and Cryptography
    Computer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.
    Databases[edit]
    Main article: Database

    This article is missing information about a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (September 2018)
    A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages.
    Informatics practices[edit]
    Informatics practices (IP) is a field of software-related study. The course mainly covers coding, software and networking concepts. This field is comparable to computer science, but lacks the hardware concepts, while focusing more on networking concepts than computer science. This branch of information science and computer science mainly focuses on the study of information processing, particularly with respect to system integration and human interactions with machine and data.[50]
    Computer applications[edit]
    Computer graphics and visualization[edit]
    Main article: Computer graphics (computer science)
    Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including computer vision, image processing, and computational geometry, and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games.
    Human–computer interaction[edit]
    Main article: Human–computer interaction
    Research that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.
    Scientific computing[edit]
    Scientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines.

    Artificial intelligence[edit]
    Main article: Artificial intelligence
    Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the Turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

    Software engineering[edit]
    Main article: Software engineering
    See also: Computer programming
    Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.
    The great insights of computer science[edit]
    The philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Insights of Computer Science:[51]
    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's, George Boole's, Alan Turing's, Claude Shannon's, and Samuel Morse's insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".[note 4]
    All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
    See also: Digital physics
    Alan Turing's insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
    Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
    move left one location;
    move right one location;
    read symbol at current location;
    print 0 at current location;
    print 1 at current location.
    See also: Turing machine
    Corrado Böhm and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".
    Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
    sequence: first do this, then do that;
    selection: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
    repetition: WHILE such-and-such is the case DO this.
    Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming).
    See also: Elementary function arithmetic § Friedman's grand conjecture
    Academia[edit]
    Further information: List of computer science conferences and Category:Computer science journals
    Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications.[52][53] One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.[54]
    Programming paradigms[edit]
    Main article: Programming paradigm
    Programming languages can be leveraged as tools to accomplish a variety of tasks. Therefore, different programming paradigms exist. A few basic programming paradigms used throughout computer science are:
    Object-Oriented Programming: "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another."
    Imperative Programming: "In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates."[55]
    Functional Programming: "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements."[56]
    Procedural Programming: "Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out."[57]
    Most programming languages offer support for multiple programming paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.[58]
