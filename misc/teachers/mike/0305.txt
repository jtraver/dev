more present in earlier

remember you are eternal spirit

you are learning to incarnate fully

grounding your body

Even practicing

being in the center of your head

spirit that you are

What does it really mean

when they start to meditate

"get out of your head"

That's different.

that expression of  

the place of the intellect

absolutely true

center of your head

reclaiming

the center of anything is the same

"well, gee, in spiritual

more in your heart, less in your head"

not true either

being in the center

driver's seat of your body-mind

it's not separate

one's heart

the core of one's beingness

for those of us who are

a physical human body

the mind-body

whichever

you can't do one without the other

that aspect of you

last lifetime

the next lifetime

you come in as a soul

in the area

that's much more associated with your heart

on a feeling level

when the body is about seven years old

comes into your body

close to the center of the head

pineal gland

small

endocrin gland

reasoning self

you as divinity

doesn't come into

the same way

two other aspects of you

three feet above your head

eighth chakra

send up

all the 

once you've experienced life

complete karmic cycle

complete and fulfilled

higher self that remains outside the body

finished

goes on vacation

eighth chakra

as long as there's something unfinished

complete your journey

let's explore

what does that really mean?

becoming more in the center of your head

various people

squeeezing in 

putting yourself into a pair of overalls

"I'm going to get in the center of my head."

container

sure, on a physical level

but, for spirit, there is no container

you can't consider your head as a container

X marks the spot

inches from the bottom of your head

physical center of your head

it's ok to start that way

you're becoming more and more aware

the concept

something to do with the center of your head

if you have any pictures

check your grounding

notice your new grounding

early Christmas present to yourself

just check to see

five o'clock to seven o'clock

center of the earth

anchored

validate your entire grounding cord

on the very microscopic level

energy that's not yours

very subtlely

but definitely

a great grounding cord

most of the time

it's doing it's job

when your grounding's not working so well

so normal, that it's not a big deal

I'm much more present here

once you have the grounding all secure

feet chakras

hello

once you say hello spirit to spirit

between you

starts to diminish

consistenty say hello

that resistance

that we put up

between ourselves

there are people that truly believe

we are separate

everything in the world

there's nothing between

separate objects

not true at all

it's erording away any of that

the more your saying hello

that

the less stuff

the whole of the universe
